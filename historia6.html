                        <p>When four weeks had passed and Hansel was still thin, impatience overcame her, and she would wait no longer. “Hey, Gretel!” she shouted to the girl, “Hurry up and fetch some water. Whether Hansel is fat or thin, tomorrow I am going to slaughter him and boil him.” </p></div>
                    
                    <img class="image" src="m9.png">

                        <p>“Climb in,” said the witch, “and see if it is hot enough to put the bread in yet.” And when Gretel was inside, she intended to push her, and eat her as well.<br>
                            But Gretel saw what she had in mind, so she said, “I don’t know how to do that. How can I get inside?” “Stupid goose,” said the old woman. The opening is big enough. See, I myself could get in.” </p></div>

                            <p>Then Gretel gave her a shove, causing her to fall in. The old woman began to howl frightfully. But Gretel ran away, and the godless witch burned up miserably.</p></div>

                            <p>How happy they were! They threw their arms around each other’s necks, jumped with joy, and kissed one another. Because they now had nothing to fear, they went into the witch’s house. In every corner were chests of pearls and precious stones.<br></p></div>
