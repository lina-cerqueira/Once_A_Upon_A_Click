                      <p>Gretel decided to immediately run away, knowing her parents plan, but amidst her hurry, ended up waking her brother.<br>"Gretel, what's wrong?"<br>
                          She cried bitter tears and said to Hansel, “It is over with us!”</p>

“Be quiet, Gretel,” said Hansel, “and don’t worry. I know what to do.”<br>
                          And as soon as the adults had fallen asleep, he got up, pulled on his jacket, opened the lower door, and crept
outside.<br> The moon was shining brightly, and the white pebbles in front of the house were glistening like silver
coins.</p>
                      </div>
            <img class="image" src="5.jpg" style="width:60%; height:60%;">

                      <p>Hansel bent over and filled his jacket pockets with them, as many as would fit.
He then took his sister by the hand and together thy walked into the woods.<br> "Don't worry Gretel, God will not forsake us.”</p>
                      </div>
            <img class="image" src="6.jpg" style="width:60%; height:60%;">

                      <p>//FART NOISE<br>
                           "Excuse me" said Hansel<p>
                      </div>
            <img class="image" src="7.jpg" style="width:60%; height:60%;">
                     
            <div id ="paragrafo1" >
                <p> Gretel put the ____ under her apron, because Hansel’s pockets were full of stones. Then all together they set
forth into the woods. After they had walked a little way, Hansel began stopping again and again and looking
back toward the house, making sure the pebbles were where he dropped them.</p>
            </div>
            <img class="image" src="9.jpg" style="width:60%; height:60%;">
            <div id ="paragrafo1" >
                <p> The father said, “Hansel, why are you stopping and looking back? Pay attention now, and don’t forget your
legs.”
“Oh, father, i” said Hansel, “I am looking at my white cat that is sitting on the roof and wants to say good-bye
to me.”
The woman said, “You fool, that isn’t your cat. That’s the morning sun shining on the chimney.”<br>However, Hansel had not been looking at his cat but instead had been dropping the shiny pebbles from his
pocket onto the path.</p>
            </div>
            <img class="image" src="10.jpg" style="width:60%; height:60%;">
            
           
            
             <div id ="paragrafo1" >
                <p> Hansel and Gretel gathered together some twigs, a pile as high as a small mountain</p>
            </div>
            
            <img class="image" src="12.jpg" style="width:60%; height:60%;">
            
            <div id ="paragrafo1" >
                <p>The twigs were set afire, and when the flames were burning well, the woman said, “Lie down by the fire and
rest. We will go into the woods to cut wood. When we are finished, we will come back and get you.”</p>
            </div>
            <img class="image" src="13.jpg" style="width:60%; height:60%;">
            
             
            
             <div id ="paragrafo1" >
                <p> Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire. When midday came each one ate his little piece of bread. After they had sat there a long
time, their eyes grew weary and closed, and they fell sound sleep.
When they finally awoke, it was dark at night. Gretel began to cry and said, “How will we get out of woods?”
Hansel comforted her, “Wait a little until the moon comes up, and then we’ll find the way.”
After the full moon had come up, Hansel took his little sister by the hand. They followed the pebbles that
glistened there like newly minted coins, showing them the way. They walked throughout the entire night, and
as morning was breaking, they arrived at the father’s house.
