outside.<br> The moon was shining brightly, and the white pebbles in front of the house were glistening like silver
coins.</p>

are going into the woods to fetch wood.” Then she gave each one a little piece of bread, saying, “Here is something
                      for midday. Don’t eat it any sooner, for you’ll not get any more.”</p>

                <p> Gretel put the bread under her apron, because Hansel’s pockets were full of stones. Then all together they set
forth into the woods. After they had walked a little way, Hansel began stopping again and again and looking
back toward the house.</p>

                <p> The father said, “Hansel, why are you stopping and looking back? Pay attention now, and don’t forget your
legs.”
“Oh, father, i” said Hansel, “I am looking at my white cat that is sitting on the roof and wants to say good-bye
to me.”
The woman said, “You fool, that isn’t your cat. That’s the morning sun shining on the chimney.”<br>However, Hansel had not been looking at his cat but instead had been dropping the shiny pebbles from his
pocket onto the path.</p>

                <p> Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire. When midday came each one ate his little piece of bread. Because they could
hear the blows of an ax, they thought that the father was nearby. However, it was not an ax. It was a branch
that he had tied to a dead tree and that the wind was beating back and forth. After they had sat there a long
time, their eyes grew weary and closed, and they fell sound sleep.
When they finally awoke, it was dark at night. Gretel began to cry and said, “How will we get out of woods?”
Hansel comforted her, “Wait a little until the moon comes up, and then we’ll find the way.”</p>

                   <div class ="text" >
                <p> After the full moon had come up, Hansel took his little sister by the hand. They followed the pebbles that
glistened there like newly minted coins, showing them the way. They walked throughout the entire night, and
as morning was breaking, they arrived at the father’s house.
