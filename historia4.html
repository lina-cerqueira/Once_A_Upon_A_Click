                        <p>And because they were so tired that their legs would no longer carry them, they lay down under a tree and fell asleep. It was already the third morning since they had left the father’s house. They started walking again, but managed only to go deeper and deeper into the woods. If help did not come soon, they would perish. At midday they saw a little snow-white bird sitting on a branch. It sang so beautifully that they stopped to listen. When it was finished it stretched its wings and flew in front of them. </p></div>

                        <p>They followed it until they came to a lit- tle house. The bird sat on the roof, and when they came closer, they saw that the little house was built entirely from bread with a roof made of cake, and the windows were made of clear sugar.
“Let’s help ourselves to a good meal,” said Hansel. “I’ll eat a piece of the roof, and Gretel, you eat from the window. That will be sweet.”
                            Hansel reached up and broke off a little of the roof to see how it tasted, while Gretel stood next to the win- dowpanes and was nibbling at them. </p></div>

                        <p>Then a gentle voice called out from inside:<br>
Nibble, nibble, little mouse, Who is nibbling at my house? The children answered:
The wind, the wind,
The heavenly child.<br>
                            Suddenly the door opened, and a woman, as old as the hills and leaning on a crutch, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so frightened that they dropped what they were holding in their hands.
                            But the old woman shook her head and said, “Oh, you dear children, who brought you here? Just come in and stay with me. No harm will come to you.”</p></div>
