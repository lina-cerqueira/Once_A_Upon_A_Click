                        <p>Afterward she made two nice beds for them, decked in white. Hansel and Gretel went to bed, thinking they were in heaven. But the old woman had only pretended to be friendly. She was a wicked witch who was lying in wait there for children. She had built her house of bread only in order to lure them to her, and if she captured one, she would kill him, cook him, and eat him; and for her that was a day to celebrate.<br>
Witches have red eyes and cannot see very far, but they have a sense of smell like animals, and know when humans are approaching.
                            When Hansel and Gretel came near to her, she laughed wickedly and thought scornfully, “Now I have them. They will not get away from me again.”</p></div>

                        <p>Early the next morning she grabbed Hansel with her withered hand and carried him to a little stall, where she locked him be- hind a cage door. Cry as he might, there was no help for him.
                            Then she shook Gretel and cried, “Get up, lazybones! Fetch water and cook something good for your brother. He is locked outside in the stall and is to be fattened up. When he is fat I am going to eat him.”</p></div>

                        <p>Every morning the old woman crept out to the stall and shouted, “Hansel, stick out your finger, so I can feel if you are fat yet.”<br>But Hansel stuck out a little bone, and the old woman, who had bad eyes and could not see the bone, thought it was Hansel’s finger, and she wondered why he didn’t get fat.</p></div>

                        <p>When four weeks had passed and Hansel was still thin, impatience overcame her, and she would wait no longer. “Hey, Gretel!” she shouted to the girl, “Hurry up and fetch some water. Whether Hansel is fat or thin, tomorrow I am going to slaughter him and boil him.” </p></div>

                        <p>“Climb in,” said the witch, “and see if it is hot enough to put the bread in yet.” And when Gretel was inside, she intended to close the oven, and bake her, and eat her as well.<br>
                            But Gretel saw what she had in mind, so she said, “I don’t know how to do that. How can I get inside?” “Stupid goose,” said the old woman. The opening is big enough. See, I myself could get in.” </p></div>

                            <p>Then Gretel gave her a shove, causing her to fall in. The old woman began to howl frightfully. But Gretel ran away, and the godless witch burned up miserably.</p></div>

                            <p>How happy they were! They threw their arms around each other’s necks, jumped with joy, and kissed one another. Because they now had nothing to fear, they went into the witch’s house. In every corner were chests of pearls and precious stones.<br></p></div>
                                
                                <!--escolha: ficar na casa ou voltar para o pai-->

                            <p>“These are better than pebbles,” said Hansel, filling his pockets.
                                Gretel said, “I will take some home with me as well,” and she filled her apron full.</p></div>

                                 <p>“But now we must leave,” said Hansel, “and get out of these witch-woods.”</p></div>
                            
                            <img class="image" src="casa2.jpg">

                            <p>The woods grew more and more familiar to them, and finally they saw the father’s house in the dis- tance. They began to run, rushed inside, and threw their arms around the father’s neck.
The man had not had even one happy hour since he had left the children in the woods. However, the woman had died. Gretel shook out her apron, scattering pearls and precious stones around the room, and Hansel added to them by throwing one handful after the other from his pockets.
                                Now all their cares were at an end, and they lived happily together.</p></div>
