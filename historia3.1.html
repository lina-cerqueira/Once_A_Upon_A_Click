                <p>Gretel went to knock on the door, but Hansel stopped her. "Wait, it's clear they don't wish for us to return, let's take some food and make our way through the forest."</p>

                        <p>When it was midday Gretel shared her bread with Hansel, who had scattered his piece along the path. Then they fell asleep, and evening passed, but no one came to get the poor children.
                            It was dark at night when they awoke, and Hansel comforted Gretel and said, “Wait, when the moon comes up I will be able to see the crumbs of bread that I scattered, and they will show us the way back home.”</p></div>
                
                <img class="image" src="m1.png">

                        <p>When the moon appeared they got up, but they could not find any crumbs, for the many thousands of birds that fly about in the woods and in the fields had pecked them up.
                            Hansel said to Gretel, “We will find our way,” but they did not find it.</p></div>
                    
                    <img class="image" src="m5.png">

                         <p>They walked through the entire night and the next day from morning until evening, but they did not find their way out of the woods. They were terribly hungry, for they had eaten only a few small berries that were growing on the ground.</p></div>
                    
                    <!--desafio das bagas*/-->

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>And because they were so tired that their legs would no longer carry them, they lay down under a tree and fell asleep. It was already the third morning since they had left the father’s house. They started walking again, but managed only to go deeper and deeper into the woods. If help did not come soon, they would perish. At midday they saw a little snow-white bird sitting on a branch. It sang so beautifully that they stopped to listen. When it was finished it stretched its wings and flew in front of them. </p></div>
                    
                    
                     <img class="image" src="m7.png">
                    
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>They followed it until they came to a lit- tle house. The bird sat on the roof, and when they came closer, they saw that the little house was built entirely from bread with a roof made of cake, and the windows were made of clear sugar.
“Let’s help ourselves to a good meal,” said Hansel. “I’ll eat a piece of the roof, and Gretel, you eat from the window. That will be sweet.”
                            Hansel reached up and broke off a little of the roof to see how it tasted, while Gretel stood next to the win- dowpanes and was nibbling at them. </p></div>
                    
                     <img class="image" src="casa.jpg">
                    
                     <div class="text">
                        <p>Then a gentle voice called out from inside:<br>
Nibble, nibble, little mouse, Who is nibbling at my house? The children answered:
The wind, the wind,
The heavenly child.<br>
                            Suddenly the door opened, and a woman, as old as the hills and leaning on a crutch, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so frightened that they dropped what they were holding in their hands.
                            But the old woman shook her head and said, “Oh, you dear children, who brought you here? Just come in and stay with me. No harm will come to you.”</p></div>

                        <p>She took them by the hand and led them into her house. Then she served them a good meal: milk and pan- cakes with sugar, apples, and nuts.</p></div>
                    
                    <img class="image" src="m13.png">
                    
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Afterward she made two nice beds for them, decked in white. Hansel and Gretel went to bed, thinking they were in heaven. But the old woman had only pretended to be friendly. She was a wicked witch who was lying in wait there for children. She had built her house of bread only in order to lure them to her, and if she captured one, she would kill him, cook him, and eat him; and for her that was a day to celebrate.<br>
Witches have red eyes and cannot see very far, but they have a sense of smell like animals, and know when humans are approaching.
                            When Hansel and Gretel came near to her, she laughed wickedly and thought scornfully, “Now I have them. They will not get away from me again.”</p></div>
                    
                    
                    <img class="image" src="m12.png">
                    
                     <div class="text">
                        <p>Early the next morning she grabbed Hansel with her withered hand and carried him to a little stall, where she locked him be- hind a cage door. Cry as he might, there was no help for him.
                            Then she shook Gretel and cried, “Get up, lazybones! Fetch water and cook something good for your brother. He is locked outside in the stall and is to be fattened up. When he is fat I am going to eat him.”</p></div>
                    
                    <img class="image" src="m14.png">
                    
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Every morning the old woman crept out to the stall and shouted, “Hansel, stick out your finger, so I can feel if you are fat yet.”<br>But Hansel stuck out a little bone, and the old woman, who had bad eyes and could not see the bone, thought it was Hansel’s finger, and she wondered why he didn’t get fat.</p></div>
                    
                    <!--desafio: escolher dedo ou mostrar o osso-->

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>When four weeks had passed and Hansel was still thin, impatience overcame her, and she would wait no longer. “Hey, Gretel!” she shouted to the girl, “Hurry up and fetch some water. Whether Hansel is fat or thin, tomorrow I am going to slaughter him and boil him.” </p></div>
                    
                    <img class="image" src="m9.png">

                        <p>“Climb in,” said the witch, “and see if it is hot enough to put the bread in yet.” And when Gretel was inside, she intended to close the oven, and bake her, and eat her as well.<br>
                            But Gretel saw what she had in mind, so she said, “I don’t know how to do that. How can I get inside?” “Stupid goose,” said the old woman. The opening is big enough. See, I myself could get in.” </p></div>
                        
                        <!--desafio de empurrar-->
                        
                        <div class="text">
                            <p>Then Gretel gave her a shove, causing her to fall in. The old woman began to howl frightfully. But Gretel ran away, and the godless witch burned up miserably.</p></div>
                        
                        <img class="image" src="m10.png">

                            <p>How happy they were! They threw their arms around each other’s necks, jumped with joy, and kissed one another. Because they now had nothing to fear, they went into the witch’s house. In every corner were chests of pearls and precious stones.<br></p></div>
                                
                                <!--escolha: ficar na casa ou voltar para o pai-->

                            <p>“These are better than pebbles,” said Hansel, filling his pockets.
                                Gretel said, “I will take some home with me as well,” and she filled her apron full.</p></div>
                            
                            <img class="image" src="9.jpg">

                                 <p>“But now we must leave,” said Hansel, “and get out of these witch-woods.”</p></div>
                            
                            <img class="image" src="casa2.jpg">

                            <p>The woods grew more and more familiar to them, and finally they saw the father’s house in the dis- tance. They began to run, rushed inside, and threw their arms around the father’s neck.
The man had not had even one happy hour since he had left the children in the woods. However, the woman had died. Gretel shook out her apron, scattering pearls and precious stones around the room, and Hansel added to them by throwing one handful after the other from his pockets.
                                Now all their cares were at an end, and they lived happily together.</p></div>
